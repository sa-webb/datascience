# easycsv
A simple Python3.6 File to perform operations on columns of csv files. 
Required packages: Pandas, Numpy

The overrall goal of this project is to serve as a tool and a reference for any data analysis on csv. 
Deployment is not goal right now, phase 1 consists of individual csv filtering capabilities and simple operations on columns of data. One capability is applying machine learning solutions to data time data. A multitude of machine learning models will be hard-coded for rapid deployment further down the road. Various regressions and clustering capabilities. 
The goal of this project is an ambiguious data science library to serve as a reference later on and also to learn machine learning capabilities. 

This project should serve as a starting toolkit to perform any anlaysis on any .csv values or database values.
