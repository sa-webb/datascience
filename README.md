The overrall goal of this project is to serve as a starting toolkit for any analysis to be performed on tabular data to serve as a reference later. A multitude of machine learning models will be hard-coded for rapid deployment further down the road; various regressions and clustering capabilities will be included. 
The success of this project will provide an ambigious machine learning component to incorporate or reference in any future systems.
